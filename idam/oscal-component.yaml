                Keycloak employs a multifaceted approach to ensure the encryption and protection of data, supporting compliance requirements. 
                It communicates over HTTPS, leveraging Transport Layer Security (TLS) to safeguard the confidentiality and integrity of data while 
                in transit. Additionally, Keycloak's token-based authentication mechanism utilizes JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to assert identity. 
                These tokens are cryptographically signed, and optionally encrypted, to validate their integrity and shield their contents. 
                As an identity provider, Keycloak also supports the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0, a robust authentication and 
                authorization protocol that uses cryptographic methods for secure single sign-on processes. By incorporating these mechanisms, 
                Keycloak provides a secure environment that aligns with compliance control requirements related to encryption and data protection.

                supports multi-factor authentication, including one-time passwords (OTP), which, by nature, are immune to replay attacks since they're valid for just one session or transaction.
